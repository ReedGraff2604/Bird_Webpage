    <h4>The great horned owl, also known as the tiger owl or the hoot owl, is a large owl native to the Americas. It is
        an extremely adaptable bird with a vast range and is the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas. Great
        horned owls live in a wide range of habitats across North, Central, and South America, including forests,
        deserts, wetlands, grasslands, and more. Great horned owls usually have babies in mid-February to late March.
        Great horned owls have very few predators, so their eggs and babies are the ones that are usually targeted.</h4>
